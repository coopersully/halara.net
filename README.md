This website was built using Markdown, HTML, and CSS for Halara Minecraft Network. It serves as a central hub for all information regarding Halara Network and it's servers (updates, events, documentation). If you happen to encounter any bugs in the website or have a suggestion for it's future development, this is the place to discuss it.

**If you have an issue with anything other than Halara Network's website itself, this is not the place to report it. [Please contact a member of Halara's staff team on their official Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZbrzN5RmyR).**
