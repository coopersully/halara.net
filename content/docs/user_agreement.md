  avoid any unnecessary confusion.

## Be respectful towards all users.

- Respect everyone- plain and simple. This includes respect for personal boundaries and public chat etiquette.
- With this being said, know the difference between banter and harassment. Banter should remain friendly and
  light-hearted, while harassment or malicious comments are strictly prohibited.
- Topics such as discrimination, malicious attacks, etc. will not be tolerated. Any discussions or actions that promote
  hatred or discrimination are not acceptable.

## Be ethical and use common sense.

- Do not attempt to find loopholes to "break" the rules. Any exploit to bypass server restrictions is considered against
  the rules.
- It is the job of the staff to interpret and enforce the server rules. Their decisions are final, and arguing with
  staff decisions can result in further actions.

## Do not spam or advertise any services or goods.

- Excessive chat and command usage is not allowed. This includes sending repetitive messages or commands in a short span
  of time.
- Advertisement in any form (chat, private message, builds, etc.) is prohibited. This includes promoting other servers,
  products, or services without authorization.

## Keep the earth clean!

- Don't leave floating trees or abandon unfinished builds. Clean up after yourself to maintain the serverâ€™s aesthetic.
- This includes dirt huts and unfixed creeper explosions in the wild. Repair the landscape to its original state where
  possible.

## Stealing and raiding are allowed in unclaimed areas.

- If your land is claimed, both the claim and the rules prohibit the raiding of said area. Ensure you claim your land to
  protect it.
- Unclaimed land is fair game- if your land is unclaimed whatsoever it can legally be raided. But remember, excessive
  griefing is never allowed.
- **Excessive griefing is not allowed in any context.** Minor damages for raiding purposes are tolerable, but severe
  destruction is deemed excessive.

## PVP is enabled and allowed.

- If you are legally killed, your items will not be refunded. Ensure to be prepared and cautious while venturing in
  dangerous zones.

{{< hint title="What qualifies as a legal kill?" text="A legal kill requires the following conditions: (1) All players' clients only contain authorized modifications; any illegal modifications will lead to disqualification and punishment. (2) There is no use of bugs or exploits that may result in an unfair advantage. Fair play is crucial for an enjoyable PVP experience." >}}

## Do not use exploits, bugs, or modifications of any kind.

- This includes lag machines, duplication glitches, etc. Utilizing these can result in a ban.
- Advantage-granting modifications and hacked clients are strictly prohibited. Adhere to the allowed modifications list
  for a fair gameplay experience.

{{< hint title="What mods can I use?" text="Halara allows the use of mods that are entirely cosmetic or performance-based only. Advantage-granting modifications and hacked clients are strictly prohibited. A list of allowed modifications can be found in the Allowed Modifications post." url="/docs/allowed_mods/" >}}

## Do not ask staff for items, permissions, roles, etc.

- Please do not put our server staff in the difficult position of declining requests for preferential treatment. Staff
  are here to ensure a fair and enjoyable environment for all.
- This does not include contacting staff for issues regarding these things. If you have a genuine issue, feel free to
  reach out.

## Enjoy yourself; we're here to serve you.

While the rules may seem overwhelming or strict at first, they really are quite easy to follow...
