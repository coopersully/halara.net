  Halara (or, "take it easy" in Greek) is a server network built around community with a passion for innovation. We have
  several different servers, with many types of gameplay to choose from, including survival, roleplay, creative, 
  minigames, and more. With each server, we aim to create a new experience that you can't find anywhere else. In 
  addition to this, our servers are constantly being updated and added to, so there's always new features to experience.
