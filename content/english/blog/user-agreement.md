In this post, you'll find the network's user agreement as well as a few bits of information that may be useful to you during your time on the server.
**By joining Halara Network, all users agree to follow the user agreement, which can be found below.**
If it's your first time joining the server, we recommend reading the user agreement in its entirety to avoid any unnecessary confusion. 

## Be respectful towards all users.
- Respect everyone- plain and simple.
- With this being said, know the difference between banter and harassment.
- Topics such as discrimination, malicious attacks, etc. will not be tolerated.

## Be ethical and use common sense.
- Do not attempt to find loopholes to "break" the rules.
- It is the job of the staff to interpret and enforce the server rules.

## Do not spam or advertise any services or goods.
- Excessive chat and command usage is not allowed.
- Advertisement in any form (chat, private message, builds, etc.) is prohibited.

## Keep the earth clean! 
- Don't leave floating trees or abandon unfinished builds.
- This includes dirt huts and unfixed creeper explosions in the wild.

## Stealing and raiding are allowed in unclaimed areas.
- If your land is claimed, both the claim and the rules prohibit the raiding of said area.
- Unclaimed land is fair game- if your land is unclaimed whatsoever it can legally be raided.
- **Excessive griefing is not allowed in any context.** You may break parts of a player's base to access locked areas, break doors, etc. but anything past this point is deemed excessive.

## PVP is enabled and allowed.
- If you are legally killed, your items will not be refunded.
### What qualifies as a 'legal kill'?
1. All players clients only contain authorized modifications.
2. There is no use of illegal exploits that may result in an unfair advantage.

## Do not use exploits, bugs, or modifications of any kind.
- This includes lag machines, duplication glitches, etc.
- Advantage-granting modifications and hacked clients are strictly prohibited.
- A list of allowed modifications can be found in [the "Allowed Modifications" post](/blog/allowed-modifications/).

## Do not ask staff for items, permissions, roles, etc.
- Please do not put our server staff in the difficult position of declining requests for preferential treatment.
- This does not include contacting staff for issues regarding these things.

## Enjoy yourself; we're here to serve you.
While the rules may seem overwhelming or strict at first, they really are quite easy to follow.
As long as you put forth good  effort into upholding the community's rules and guidelines, you'll be just fine.
The purpose of the moderation team is to ensure the safety  and security of the server while also bettering the experience of its users.
All of that to say: if you truly try to follow the rules and mess up every once in a while, don't sweat it- we've got your best in mind.  
*Sincerely, Curse, founder of Halara Network*
