Each individual player does not have to kill a new dragon, it is only required to be killed once.

# 07. Acquire one (1) of every overworld wood type.
Travel the lands of the overworld and gather at least one log or plank of each type of wood. A list of each required wood-type is below:
* Oak
* Spruce
* Birch
* Jungle
* Acacia
* Dark Oak
* Mangrove

Note that stripped variants are not required to complete this task.

# 08. Create a rainbow sheep!
Grab a nametag and rename it to "jeb_" in an anvil. Use this nametag on a sheep
to make him change colors!

# 09. Perform a purification ritual.
Use 1x Weakness Potion and 1x Golden Apple to perform a purification ritual. A better
look at how to perform this task can be seen on [the event's main page](https://mc.halara.net/blog/halara-with-consequences/).
* The ritual performed does not have to be a super purification, but either is applicable.

# 10. Enchant an item to god-tier.
An item that has all possible vanilla enchantments at their maximum values is said to be "god-tier." For example,
a god-tier pair of boots would require Protection IV, Unbreaking III, and Mending.
* There are no restrictions on what item is to be enchanted. It can be any item.
* If you're unsure about what makes a god-tier weapon, feel free to ask a staff member.

# Get out of jail free card!
Here at Halara, we believe in violence. If you can kill a player, you can omit one (1) task from your
list. This can only be redeemed once per team.
