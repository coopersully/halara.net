If you're late to the party, Minecraft: Java Edition 1.19 is out everywhere; and with the new update
comes a new season of Halara! Welcome to Halara: Season 3. Here are a few of the highlights:
	
- No map reset this time; this includes inventory, etc.
- All MCMMO skills from previous seasons will be kept. This point may carry on to future seasons; we're testing out skill carry-overs.
- 50+ Treasure Items to collect, upgrade, & explore with 2 new questlines.
- Treasure Items are being slowly integrated into the world, so look out for new items in dungeon loot and boss fights!
- THE WARDEN's loot is pretty lame in survival. We upgraded his loot table to drop a few new goodies.
    * The rare Treasure Item "Warden's Ear" drops from killing the Warden and can be used to create "Sculk Boots" that can highlight nearby mobs.
    * The epic Treasure Item "Warden's Heart" drops from killing the Warden and can be used to craft the "Grimsteel" armor set... with crazy powerful thorns.
- THE ENDERDRAGON's loot has also been revamped, with the potential to drop a few of the following items:
    * ENDER'S EDGE is a netherite sword with the power to short-range teleport.
    * HEAVY BLASTSHIELDS are upgraded versions of the vanilla shield that also grant armor and (possibly) speed boosts.
- THE WITHER'S loot has been slightly updated as well.
    * WITHERING SPIRITS are an epic treasure item that can drop from the wither. I wonder that they're used for...
- A few other Treasure Items are also now available through various means...
    * BOW OF THE BOUNTY (BOW)
    * CROCO-BOW (BOW)
    * INFERNIUM (ARMOR SET)
    * STARLESS NIGHT (SWORD)
    * MINER'S HARD HAT (HELMET)
- "Cave Traders" now spawn rarely on players while mining. They offer rare (and sometimes random) trades for minerals, food, potions, and exclusive treasure items.
- Economy is being re-balanced slowly, so you may see some updates to the prices of spawners, etc.
