If you're late to the party, Minecraft: Java Edition 1.19 is out everywhere; and with the new update
comes a new season of Halara! Welcome to Halara: Season 3. Here are a few of the highlights:
	
- **No map reset this time**; this includes inventory, etc.
- **All MCMMO skills from previous seasons will be kept**. This point may carry on to future seasons; we're testing out skill carry-overs.
- **There are 50+ new Treasure Items** to collect, upgrade, & explore with 2 new questlines.
- Treasure Items are being slowly integrated into the world, so look out for new items in dungeon loot and boss fights!
- Let's be honest, The Warden's loot is pretty lame in survival. We upgraded his loot table to drop a few new goodies:
    * **"Warden's Ear"** drops from killing the Warden
		* This can be used to create **"Sculk Boots"** that can highlight nearby mobs.
    * **"Warden's Heart"** drops from killing the Warden
		* This can be used to craft the **"Grimsteel"** armor set.
- The Enderdragon's loot has also been revamped, with the potential to drop a few of the following items:
    * **"Ender's Edge** is a legendary sword with the power to short-range teleport.
    * **"Enderic Heavy Blastshields"** are upgraded versions of the vanilla shield that also grant armor and (possibly) speed boosts.
- The Wither's loot has been slightly updated as well.
    * **"Withering Spirits"** are an epic treasure item that can drop from the wither.
- A few other Treasure Items are also now available through various means...
    * **"Bow of the Bounty"** (BOW)
    * **"Croco-Bow"** (BOW)
    * **"Infernium** (ARMOR SET)
    * **"The Starless Night"** (SWORD)
    * **"Miner's Hard hat"** (HELMET)
- "Cave Traders" now spawn rarely on players while mining. They offer rare (and sometimes random) trades for minerals, food, potions, and exclusive treasure items.
- Economy is being re-balanced slowly, so you may see some updates to the prices of spawners, etc.
