## Tournament Details
A custom gamemode developed by Halara Network that is based off of Minecraft's vanilla
"Hardcore" difficulty. However, this gamemode has a few twists added to it (I mean, c'mon, 
it's literally in the company motto).

## How to enter
Entry is free of charge for all players; all you need to do is show up on the scheduled tournament date. There
is a maximum of twenty-five (25) players for this tournament, so if you'd like to secure a spot, react to the message in Halara's
Discord to ensure that your spot is secured.

* **IP Address:** ``play.halara.net``

## How to play

### Complete the tasks
All players begin at the same time with the same book, given upon tournament start.
* This book contains a set list of tasks to complete
* These tasks are identical for every player.

### Individual or duo
You may play by yourself or with one (1) other person of your choosing.
* Teams may not exceed two (2) players total.
* Each player must purchase their own entry ticket.

## ... With Consequences
### Every time you die, you lose one (1) heart permanently.
* If you have more than one (1) heart upon death, you will respawn.
* Once you lose all of your hearts, you will be banned for twenty-four (24) hours.
	* Upon re-joining, if the tournament is still ongoing, you will once again have full hearts.
	
### Players can regain hearts by preforming purification rituals.

#### Purification Ritual
* Apply **1x Weakness Potion** to your player and eat **1x Golden Apple**.
* This will grant the player one (1) more heart.

#### Super Purification Ritual
* Apply **1x Weakness Potion** to your player and eat **1x Enchanted Golden Apple**.
* This will restore the player's health completely.

### No players health can exceed ten (10) permanent hearts
This is not necessarily a rule, but it's limited by the server. Rituals can still be performed
at ten (10) hearts, but will grant no health increase.

### The first individual/team to complete all of the tasks wins.
The winning team recieves one (1) of the three (3) rewards listed below.
1. The **Crown of Shadows** treasure-item (Dark Rarity, Nightmare Infused).
2. A one-time grant of ten-million dollars ($10,000,000) of in-game currency.
3. A free grant of **MVP Rank** for both teammates.

## Scheduling & start time
It will take place on **Monday, June 27th, 2022** and will run from the start date until a player/team has
completed the required tasks to win the tournament.
