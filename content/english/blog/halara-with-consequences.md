## Tournament Details
A custom gamemode developed by Halara Network that is based off of Minecraft's vanilla
"Hardcore" difficulty. However, this gamemode has a few twists added to it (I mean, c'mon, 
it's literally in the company motto).

## How to enter
All participants must purchase a $2.00 Tournament Entry ticket in order to participate. This guarentees you a spot in the tournament.
In the days leading up to the tournament, this page will update with a link to purchase a ticket online as well as an IP address.
* **IP Address:** ``NOT YET AVAILABLE``
* **Purchase an Entry Ticket:** [Click here to purchase an entry ticket.](https://halara.tebex.io/category/events)

## How to play

### Complete the tasks
All players begin at the same time with the same book, given upon tournament start.
* This book contains a set list of tasks to complete
* These tasks are identical for every player.

### Individual or duo
You may play by yourself or with one (1) other person of your choosing.
* Teams may not exceed two (2) players total.
* Each player must purchase their own entry ticket.

## ... With Consequences
### Every time you die, you lose one (1) heart permanently.
* If you have more than one (1) heart upon death, you will respawn.
* Once you lose all of your hearts, you will be banned for twenty-four (24) hours.
	* Upon re-joining, if the tournament is still ongoing, you will once again have full hearts.
	
### Players can regain hearts by preforming purification rituals.

#### Purification Ritual
* Apply **1x Weakness Potion** to your player and eat **1x Golden Apple**.
* This will grant the player one (1) more heart.

#### Super Purification Ritual
* Apply **1x Weakness Potion** to your player and eat **1x Enchanted Golden Apple**.
* This will restore the player's health completely.

### No players health can exceed ten (10) permanent hearts
This is not necessarily a rule, but it's limited by the server. Rituals can still be performed
at ten (10) hearts, but will grant no health increase.

### The first individual/team to complete all of the tasks wins.
The winning team recieves the entirety of the cash pool, determined by the amount of entry tickets purchased.
* Halara makes no money off of this tournament.
* There is only one winning team/individual.
* Payment will be equally divided between team members.
* Payment can be performed via PayPal or Venmo.

## Scheduling & start time
The tournament currently does not have a set date, one is being voted upon right now in Halara's Discord server.
It will take place somewhere between **Jun 26 - Jul 2** and will run from the start date until a player/team has
completed the required tasks to win the tournament. [If you'd like to join the Discord server and take part in voting
on the tournament date, you can do so by clicking here.](https://discord.com/invite/ZbrzN5RmyR)
