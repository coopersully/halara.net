# Welcome to Halara.
**Halara (or, “take it easy” in Greek) is a server network built around community with a passion for innovation.**
We have several different servers, with many types of gameplay to choose from, including survival, roleplay, creative, minigames, and more.
With each server, we aim to create a new experience that you can't find anywhere else.
In addition to this, our servers are constantly being updated and added to, so there's always new features to experience.

## Our Motivation
Innovation is what many servers lack; each server is repetitive with the same beliefs and ideas.
Halara aims to overhaul the Minecraft multiplayer experience in every way it can.

## Excellence and Professionalism
With over five years of experience, we've learned a thing or two about running a Minecraft server.
Our administrative team has carefully picked and customized each modification to the server to perfectly play it's own role.

# Quotes from Server Members

A quote from DrunkxCop, a member for 1+ years
> It sounds stupid, but Halara's like my little internet family. [Halara's owner] Curse really cares about his craft
and takes his time to perfect the details of the server no one even notices. It's a nice experience, yes, but 
more importantly it's a genuine one.

A quote from Kilpathicc, a member for 3+ years
> Halara's got a great community, a lot of which I call friends. They stay up to date on a variety of games and game news, and the servers are some of the most fun I've had.

A quote from ProHistoric, a member for 1+ years
> Halara is probably one of the most easy-going Minecraft experiences I’ve ever had.
It has an amazing community, and every day the moderation team is working on something special and eventually you get the most spectacular updates- different than anything you’ve ever seen. 
To my knowledge, Halara has a few aspects that I have never seen on any other server; it makes it super fun and unique and gives an experience that no other server can really offer.

> Halara has reignited my love for Minecraft with its discrete but unique additions to the vanilla experience.
